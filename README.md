### What is this?
Newser - is a news aggregator designed to make it easier to view news by category.

I tried to write a beautiful interface that would be pleasing to the eye  
and force the user to return to the application again.

  
### Stack:
Language - Dart  
Framework - Flutter  
API - New Your Times API (only for personal use)  

  
### A few words:
During development,  
I used Clean Architecture, worked with BLoC and Retrofit. 

This app helped me to better understand state management and working with the Rest API. 

### !!!:
For use get api key from https://developer.nytimes.com/apis and set to api_key.dart in project directory
